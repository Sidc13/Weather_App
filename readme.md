Dear reader,
This is a weather app made using HTML, tailwind CSS and javascript.
The purpose of this web application is for learning and applying the technologies/functionalities the developer has worked on so far, namely, writing markups and code.
The approach here is to create the html and javascript files, install tailwind css, and then get the structure ready.
Then the objective is to properly set up the UI, following which is to add functionality using fetch/async-await.

COMPLETE STEP-BY-STEP DEVELOPMENT MAP:

1. Create and push html boilerplate.
2. Create an empty javascipt file script.js and then push the file to git, github.
3. Set up an environment for Tailwind: Install tailwind CSS using the tailwind CLI tool (no custom PostCSS pipeline) then create an 'src' folder with 'index.html' 'input.css' and 'output.css'. Link the HTML file with 'output.css'.
4. Create a gitignore file to ignore files that are not needed, namely node modules, environment variables and so on.
5. Develop a simple UI for the weather app, there will be a search bar for naming the city the user wants. There will be a space/hero section where the current weather will be displayed. Below that we will have a 5-day forecast (smaller boxes showcasing the details). The same shall be optimized for different screen sizes: Desktop, iPad mini, iPhone SE.
